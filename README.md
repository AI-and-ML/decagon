# Decagon

*Decagon* is a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) approach for multirelational link 
prediction in multimodal graphs. 

It is a general approach for multirelational link prediction in any multimodal network. 
Decagon handles multimodal graphs with large numbers of edge types. It works on simple and 
multimodal graphs. 

Please check the [project page](http://snap.stanford.edu/decagon) for more details, including the preprocessed datasets for modeling drug combinations.
  
## Usage

Decagon has been used to solve problems in computational pharmacology, specifically to model 
*polypharmacy side effects of drug pairs (i.e., drug combinations)*.

Using Decagon, we construct a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon then predicts the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically.

Decagon species a graph convolutional neural network architecture based on this multimodal graph to model and predict polypharmacy side effects.

All preprocessed datasets used for polypharmacy side effect prediction are available for download from the [project page](http://snap.stanford.edu/decagon).

## Miscellaneous

Please send any questions you might have about the code and/or the 
algorithm to <marinka@cs.stanford.edu>.

This code implements several different edge decoders (innerproduct, distmult, 
bilinear, dedicom) and loss functions (hinge loss, cross entropy). Many deep variants are possible and what works 
best might depend on a concrete use case.  

## Dependencies

Decagon is tested to work under Python 2 and Python 3.

The required dependencies for Decagon are [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) >= 1.13, [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) >= 2.0, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) >= 1.5.
